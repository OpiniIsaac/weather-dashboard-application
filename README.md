**Weather Dashboard**
    
This project is a web dashboard that allows users to search for weather conditions in different cities. It's built using React and Vite, providing a fast development environment for modern web applications.

**Project Setup**

This project is a weather dashboard built with React and Vite for a modern and efficient development experience. To set up your local development environment, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can verify these by running `node -v` and `npm -v` (or `yarn -v`) in your terminal.
   - If you don't have them, download and install Node.js from the official website ([https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)). Node.js typically comes bundled with npm.

2. **Clone or Download the Repository:**
   - If you have Git installed, clone the repository using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/OpiniIsaac/weather-dashboard-application.git
     ```

   - Alternatively, you can download the ZIP archive of the repository and extract it to your desired location.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Navigate to the project directory in your terminal:
     ```bash
     cd weather-dashboard-application
     ```
   - Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
    

4. **Start the Development Server:**
   - Run the following command to start the Vite development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
     (or `yarn dev`)
   - This will typically launch the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:5173/

**Project Structure**

The project is likely to have the following basic structure (assuming a standard React project setup):

- `public/`: Contains static assets like images, favicons, etc.
- `src/`: Contains the source code for your React application.
    - `App.js`: The main application entry point.
    - `components/`: Houses reusable UI components (e.g., `Search`, `WeatherCard`).
    - `services/`: Contains logic for fetching weather data (e.g., `fetchWeatherData`).
    - `styles/`: Contains global or component-specific styles (optional).
    - `index.js`: Renders the root React component.
